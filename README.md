# Python4DataAnalysis
This is my Jupyter Notebook exercise code for the book(P4DA), anyone can get the dataset and code from the official github repo.I just use this repo as my personal exercise and I haven't finished typing and learning these codes yet.

#Intro of **Python for Data Analysis**

This is a book written by **Wes McKinney** who is the author of **Pandas**, an amazing library for data analysis. The book require IPython as a tool to write and implement, but in theory you can write on any IDE based on Python with proper libraries installed, so I guess **[Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)** is one that you can quickly and easily take up.

Feel free to communicate and learn together.
